Then, I need to find the entity facilitating dialogue with consumer groups against Meta. Next, I need to identify the entity deploying staff within its AI Office for future regulations. Finally, I need to find the entity previously focused on illegal content and disinformation issues related to the Israel-Hamas war. After gathering all these pieces, I will determine the entity that matches all these criteria.",
